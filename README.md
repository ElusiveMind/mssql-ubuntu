# MSSQL Server, SQLSRV and MySQL Workbench Template
The purpose of this repository is to provide a template for installing PHP drivers for PHP drivers for MSSQL and the PHP Document Object (PDO) connection mechanism against PHP 8.3.

It also provides commands for installing MySQL workbench via command line along with all of the relevant dependencies.

These are done using Ubuntu 24.04 as a base operating system.

This is a companion repository to [mssql2mysql](https://github.com/ElusiveMind/mssql2mysql) that can be used as a backbone to transfer data and schema from a MSSQL database to MySQL/MariaDB.

More information can be found on how this works can be found at [this blog post](https://www.flyingflip.com/article/converting-mssql-databases-to-mysql-using-php)
